Python(3.10)
IN the first question(AS1_Reverse) I took the input string from console and created a new list and then filled the list with individual characters from the string taken and then deleted atleast two characters from it  and then reversed it and again converted the indivial charcaters list as a string and then printed it.
IN the first sub question (AS1_airthmetic) I took the two inputs x and y and performed add, sub, div and multiplication operations and printed the outputs accordingly.
IN the second question I took a sentence as input and created a list so that I can assign the value to the words in the sentence and created the new list in which if i found the word "python" I replaced it with word "pythons". and then changed the list into string and printed it.
IN the third question I took the class score as marks and then taken input and used "if" "elif" conditions and according with grading criteria I have given grades to the marks secured.
